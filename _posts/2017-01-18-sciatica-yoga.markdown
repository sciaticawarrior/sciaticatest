# Yoga Routines for Sciatica

Last year I wrote an article on a sciatica workout I found to be very useful. This time I wanted to focus exclusively on yoga. I have been practicing yoga for the last two years in an attempt help manage my sciatica nerve pain. Overall, it has been very effective at pain management. Like I mentioned in the about section, I have suffered from sciatica, leg and lower back pain, bulging disk for about 8 years now. I have tried several types of treatments and I want to share my experiences with anyone who may be in a similar situation. The follow yoga routines are great for stretching and strengthening my core. Through my own research, talking with doctors and yoga instructors I have found that strengthening my core and reducing tightness in my hip, glutes, hamstrings and lower back really does help manage sciatica. 

## Light Pain Reduction Routine
This yoga routine is great for stretching out hips, glutes and hamstrings. It is fairly light and can be done after a workout or by itself to get some pain relief. Make sure to keep I back straight throughout all the poses. Make sure my back is not arched. Also, ease into every stretch and go slow. If I feel one is giving me pain then I use a modified form or skip it.

* Cat pose
* Table Pose
