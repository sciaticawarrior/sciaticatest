Welcome to my blog! I hope you find these posts useful if you are suffering from sciatica/herniated disk/pinched nerves/lower back pain. I'll be posting interesting items on living with and managing sciatica. I've lived with these issues for over 7 years now so believe I know your pain (no punt intended). I consider myself a Sciatica Warrior and you should too! To learn more about me click on the [About page](http://sciaticawarrior.github.io/sciaticaworkout/about/).
